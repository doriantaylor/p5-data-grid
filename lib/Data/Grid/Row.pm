=head1 NAME

Data::Grid::Row - Row implementation for Data::Grid::Table

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02_01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02_01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # CSV files are themselves only a single table, so the list
    # context assignment here takes the first and only one.
    my ($table) = Data::Grid->parse('foo.csv')->tables;

    while (my $row = $table->next) {
        my @cells = $row->cells;
        # or
        @cells = @$row;

        # or, if column names were supplied somehow:

        my %cells = $row->as_hash;
        # or
        %cells = %$row;
    }

=head1 METHODS

=head2 table

Retrieve the L<Data::Grid::Table> object to which this row
belongs. Alias for L<Data::Grid::Container/parent>.

=cut

sub table {
    $_[0]->parent;
}

=head2 cells [$FLATTEN]

Retrieve the cells from the row, as an array in list context or
arrayref in scalar context. The array dereferencing operator C<@{}> is
also overloaded and works like this:

    my @cells = @$row;

=cut

sub cells {
    Carp::croak("This method is a stub; it must be overridden!");
}

=head2 width

Returns the width of the row in columns. This is the same as C<scalar
@{$row-E<gt>cells}>.

=cut

sub width {
    # flatten the cells, because no sense in spending any effort
    # computing results that get immediately thrown away
    scalar @{$_[0]->cells(1)};
}

=head2 as_hash [$FLATTEN]

If the table has a heading or its columns were designated in the
constructor or with L<Data::Grid::Table/columns>, this method will
return the row as key-value pairs in list context and a HASH reference
in scalar context. If there is no column spec, this method will
generate dummy column names starting from 1, like C<col1>, C<col2>,
etc. It will also fill in the blanks if the column spec is shorter
than the actual row. If the column spec is longer, the overhang will
be populated with C<undef>s. As well it is worth noting that duplicate
keys will be clobbered with the rightmost value at this time, though
that behaviour may change.

=cut

sub as_hash {
    my ($self, $flatten) = @_;

    my @cells = $self->cells;
    my @cols  = $self->parent->columns;

    # XXX this should probably be the global width but whatev
    @cols = map { "col$_" } (1..scalar @cells) unless @cols;

    my %out;
    for my $i (0..$#cols) {
        $out{$cols[$i]} = ($flatten && ref $cells[$i]) ?
            $cells[$i]->value : $cells[$i];
    }
    wantarray ? %out : \%out;
}

=head2 as_string

Returns the row as CSV, quoted where necessary, minus the newline.

=cut

sub as_string {
    join ',', map { $_->quoted } $_[0]->cells;
}
