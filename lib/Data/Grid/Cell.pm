=head1 NAME

Data::Grid::Cell - Cell implementation for Data::Grid::Row

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01_01

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01_01';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    for my $cell (@$cells) {
        warn $cell->value;

        # string overload
        printf "%s\n", $cell;
    }

=head1 METHODS

=head2 value

Retrieves a representation of the value of the cell, potentially
formatted by the source, versus a possible alternate L</literal>
value. This method is a I<stub>, and should be defined in a driver
subclass. If the cell is stringified, compared numerically or tested
for truth, this is the method that is called, like so:

     print "$cell\n"; # stringification overloaded

=cut

sub value {
    Carp::croak("Somebody forgot to override this method.");
}

=head2 literal

Spreadsheets tend to have a literal value underlying a formatted value
in a cell, which is why we have this class and are not just using
scalars to represent cells. If your driver has literal values,
override this method, otherwise it is a no-op.

=cut

sub literal {
    $_[0]->value;
}

=head2 row

Alias for L<Data::Grid::Container/parent>.

=cut

sub row {
    $_[0]->parent;
}
