=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Grid;

    # Have the parser guess the kind of file, using defaults.

    my $grid = Data::Grid->parse('arbitrary.xls');

    # or

    my $grid = Data::Grid->parse(
        source  => 'arbitrary.csv', # or xls, or xlsx, or filehandle...
        header  => 1,               # first line is a header everywhere
        columns => [qw(a b c)],     # override the header
        options => \%options,       # driver-specific options
    );

    # Each object contains one or more tables.

    for my $table ($grid->tables) {

        # Each table has one or more rows.

        while (my $row = $table->next) {

            # The columns can be dereferenced as an array,

            my @cols = @$row; # or just $row->columns

            # or, if header is present or fields were named in the
            # constructor, as a hash.

            my %cols = %$row;

            # Now we can do stuff.
        }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 4

=item Problem 1

You have a mountain of data files from two decades of using MS Office
(and other) products, and you want to collate their contents into
someplace sane.

=item Problem 2

The files are in numerous different formats, and a consistent
interface would really cut down on the effort of extracting them.

=item Problem 3

You've looked at L<Data::Table> and L<Spreadsheet::Read>, but deemed
their table-at-a-time strategy to be inappropriate for your purposes.

=back

The goal of L<Data::Grid> is to provide an extensible, uniform,
object-oriented interface to all kinds of grid-shaped data. A key
behaviour I'm after is to perform an incremental read over a
potentially large data source, so as not to unnecessarily gobble up
system resources.

=head1 DEVELOPER RELEASE

Odds are I will probably decide to change the interface at some point
before locking in, and I don't want to guarantee consistency yet. If I
do, and you use this, your code will probably break.

Suffice to say this module is B<ALPHA QUALITY> at best.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 parse $FILE | %PARAMS

The principal way to instantiate a L<Data::Grid> object is through the
C<parse> factory method. You can either pass it a filelike thing or a
set of parameters. I<Filelike thing> is either a filename, C<GLOB>
reference, C<SCALAR> reference or C<ARRAY> reference of scalars. If
the filelike thing is passed alone, its type will be detected using
L<File::MMagic>. To tune this behaviour, use the parameters:

=over 4

=item source

This is equivalent to C<$file>.

=item header

If you know that the document you're opening has a header, set this
flag to a true value and it will be consumed for use in
L<Data::Grid::Row/as_hash>. If there is more than one table in the
document, set this value to an C<ARRAY> reference of flags. This
object will be treated as a ring, meaning that, for instance, if the
header designation is C<[1, 0]>, the third table in the document will
be treated as having a header, fourth will not, the fifth will, and so
on.

=cut

my $zero_aref = sub { [0] };

has header => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => HeaderFlags,
    coerce  => 1,
    default => $zero_aref,
);

=item columns

Specify a list of columns in lieu of a header, or otherwise override
any header, which is thrown away. A single C<ARRAY> reference of
strings will be duplicated to each table in the document. An array of
arrays will be applied to each table with the same wrapping behaviour
as C<header>.

=cut

has columns => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => Fields,
    coerce  => 1,
    default => sub { [] },
);

=item start

Set a row offset, i.e, a number of rows to skip I<before> any header.
Since this is an offset, it starts with zero. Same rule applies for
multiple tables in the document.

=cut

has start => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => Offsets,
    coerce  => 1,
    default => $zero_aref,
);

=item skip

Set a number of rows to skip I<after> the header, defaulting, of
course, to zero. Same multi-table rule applies.

=cut

has skip => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => Offsets,
    coerce  => 1,
    default => $zero_aref,
);

=item options

This C<HASH> reference will be passed as-is to the driver.

=item driver

Specify a driver and bypass type detection. Modules under the
L<Data::Grid> namespace can be handed in as L<CSV|Data::Grid::CSV>,
L<Excel|Data::Grid::Excel>, and L<Excel::XLSX|Data::Grid::Excel::XLSX>.
Prefix with a C<+> for other package namespaces.

=item checker

Specify either L<MMagic|File::MMagic> or L<MimeInfo|File::MimeInfo> to
detect the type of file. L<MMagic|File::MMagic> is the default. In
lieu of the class name

how to extend this package.

=head2 table_class

Returns the class to use for instantiating tables. Defaults to
L<Data::Grid::Table>, which is an abstract class. Override this
accessor and its neighbours with your own values for extensions.

=head2 row_class

=head2 cell_class

=head2 table_params $POSITION

Generate a set of parameters suitable for passing in as a constructor,

=cut

    my %p = (parent => $self, position => $pos);

    # okay this goes through all similar arrayref members and picks
    # the element that corresponds to the table modulo the length of
    # the list of tables, which frankly is pretty clever
    for my $k (qw(header columns start skip)) {
        my @x = @{$self->$k || []};
        $p{$k} = $x[$pos % @x] if @x;
